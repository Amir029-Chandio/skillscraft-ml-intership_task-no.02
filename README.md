# Task 02: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Objective
To implement a **K-Means Clustering** algorithm that segments retail customers based on their shopping patterns.

## 🧠 Dataset
The **Mall Customer Dataset** includes features such as:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1–100)`

These features help identify distinct customer groups with similar purchasing behaviors.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn / Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Output
- Visualization of clusters using 2D and 3D plots
- Segmented customer groups for targeted marketing

## 📁 Files
- `mall_customer_dataset.csv`: Original dataset
- `kmeans_clustering_model.ipynb`: Implementation and results

## 🏢 Internship
This task was completed under the **Skillscraft Technology** Machine Learning Internship Program 2025.
